This is a directory of activist projects, groups and events. It is currently made with a focus on Naarm (Melbourne).

Our goal is to reduce our reliance on corporate social media in the way that we do the work to build and strengthen our communities, to end violence and exploitation, and to protect our precious land, water and skies. 

This website was made by volunteers on the Boon Wurrung and Wurundjeri lands of the Kulin Nation. We pay respect to their elders past, present and future. We recognise and honour the long long history of community organising and resistance to colonial invasion and occupation on these lands. Sovereignty was never ceded. Always was, always will be Aboriginal land.
