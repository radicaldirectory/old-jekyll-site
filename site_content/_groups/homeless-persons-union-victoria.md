The Homeless Persons Union of Victoria seeks to build an effective and self-sustaining organisation whose goal is to ensure the human rights of the homeless and powerless are not ignored, but are taken seriously by government, service providers and society. It seeks to do this by bringing together those who have a lived experience of homelessness and those who are passionate about the rights of the homeless.
