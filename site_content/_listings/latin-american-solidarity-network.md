In Australia, LASNET aims to raise awareness of the struggles of Latin American people and works to support these initiatives through local and national activism.

We also aim to bring the Latin American example as a way of providing hope to those of us struggling in Australia against greed and increasing authoritarianism.

Also, we are totally against capitalism and patriarchalism, we support all collective struggles that promote equality in the diversity of the world we are living, without discrimination and borders.
