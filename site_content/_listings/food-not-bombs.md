Food Not Bombs is a worldwide movement that cooks and distributes vegan organic food to anyone and everyone, without restriction.
The Melbourne chapter of the organisation gathers leftover organic fruit and vegetables from Queen Victoria Market, gives some to worthy causes, then cooks up the rest and share it on the streets of Brunswick Street, Fitzroy, Coburg and Footscray.
Everything is paid for by fundraising gigs, catering gigs, donations where people can afford them and even from the pockets of the volunteers themselves.
Basically they're a well wicked awesome group who do good for the streets of Melbourne and they need you're hard earned dosh!
Volunteers are always welcome .
